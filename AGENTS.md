## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This repository (`xiaoerGame`) is currently an empty/skeleton project with only a `README.md`. There is no application code, no build system, no dependencies, and no services to run.

- **No package manager lockfile or dependency manifest exists** — no `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.
- **No lint, test, or build commands are available.**
- **No services need to be started.**

When source code is added, this section should be updated with relevant development setup instructions.
